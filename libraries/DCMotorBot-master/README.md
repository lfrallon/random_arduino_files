DCMotorBot
==========

DC Motor Bot is an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) library that allows you control bots created with 2 DC motors and H-Bridge IC like L293D.

##Features
The library supports the following operations

- Move Up
- Move Down
- Move Left
- Move Right
- Start
- Stop

## Examples
The library has an example sketch under the /examples folder which explains how to control the bot.

BasicBot.ino â€“ Shows the normal way of using the library

## Dependency

This library does not require any other library to work.

## Setup

After downloading place the DCMotorBot folder inside your Arduino's library folder

Connect the DC motors to Arduino using H-Bridge IC like L293D. 

You can find a copy of L293D's [datasheet](datasheet/l293d.pdf) and [pin out diagram](datasheet/l293d-pinout.png) inside in the /datasheet directory

The following is the pin out diagram of the IC.
